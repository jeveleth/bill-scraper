To use:

TODOs: 
* hook up to API [done]
* format timestamp
* add all search terms 
* Handle secrets: API Token [done]
* Parameterize input (so users can grab a state)
* convert to a CLI tool

This repo allows users to run a binary that will generate a CSV file that contains all relevant legislation for a given state.
Tested on a Mac, so it doesn't yet cross-compile for windows or linux.
